# Interactive Registration Form 

## Overview

This project is a registration form that demonstrates real-time form validation using HTML5 and JavaScript. It was developed during a hands-on lab at PerScholas to reinforce front-end development concepts including form structure, validation, DOM manipulation, and local storage.


## The Challenge
* By the end of this lab, I was able to:
* Structure a semantic HTML form with proper input fields.
* Implement real-time validation using JavaScript input event listeners.
* Use HTML5 validation attributes like required, type, minlength, and pattern.
* Apply the JavaScript Constraint Validation API for advanced validation.
* Display custom and dynamic error messages next to invalid fields.
* Prevent default form submission and perform final checks.
* Use localStorage to save and retrieve form data (e.g., username).
